Your task is simple. You have to call counter.count(int) with the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive. So a simple solution might look like this:

for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  counter.count(i);
}
But there's a catch. Your solution also has to satisfy the following conditions:

Three different threads must be used
Numbers of the form 3n (multiples of 3) must be called in one thread
Numbers of the form 3n + 1 must be called in a second
Numbers of the form 3n + 2 must be called in a third
The numbers have to be called in sequence 1 to 100
Also, make sure your method doesn't return until all three threads have completed. Otherwise the tests may not work even if your solution is correct.
